Spelling it out to see what needs to be done and what needs to be renamed (such as yDeltaPillarsOuter).

Parts of a carport SVG as seen from above:
    Viewport Rect:
        As large as possible while still fitting comfortably on the screen.
    Viewbox Rect:
        Scaled up if rect(carport + guides) is too large to fit within the viewport.

    Carport Rect - x, y, w and h of carport. Depends on:
        Viewport rect (we want to center the carport within the viewport)
    Horizontal Support Bars:
        x: Depends on carport.x
        yDeltaPillarsOuter: The distance from the uppermost part of the upper support bar
                            to the lowest part of the lower support bar. Depends on carport size.
        w: Same as carport.w (still seen from above)
        h: Some number of cm, not too important.
    Rafters:
        Amounts: depends on this.x
        x values: Maximum 60 cm distance between the centers of two rafters.
        y: Same as carport.y
        w: Pretty arbitrary
        h: Same as carport.h
    Pillars:
        Amount: Depends on carport.w
        x positions: Spread out along the support bars
        y positions: Same as support bars'
        w and h: Same as support bar height

    Measurement guides:
        Carport h guide: Depends on carport.h
        yDeltaPillarsOuter guide: Depends on support bars' yDeltaPillarsOuter.
        Rafter guides: Depends on rafters
