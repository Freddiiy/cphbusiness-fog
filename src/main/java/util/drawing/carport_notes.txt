Spelling it out to see what needs to be done and what needs to be renamed (such as yDeltaPillarsOuter).

Parts of a carport SVG as seen from above:
    Viewport Rect:
        As large as possible while still fitting comfortably on the screen.
    Viewbox Rect:
        Scaled up if rect(carport + guides) is too large to fit within the viewport.

    Carport Rect - x, y, l and w of carport. Depends on:
        Viewport rect (we want to center the carport within the viewport)
    Horizontal Support Bars:
        x: Depends on carport.x
        yDeltaPillarsOuter: The distance from the uppermost part of the upper support bar
                            to the lowest part of the lower support bar. Depends on carport size.
        l: Same as carport.l (still seen from above)
        w: Some number of cm, not too important.
    Rafters:
        Amounts: depends on carport.l
        x values: Maximum 60 cm distance between the centers of two rafters.
        y: Same as carport.y
        l: Pretty arbitrary
        w: Same as carport.w
    Pillars:
        Amount: Depends on carport.l/support bar.l
        x positions: Spread out along the support bars
        y positions: Same as support bars'
        l and w: Same as support bar height

    Measurement guides:
        Carport w guide: Depends on carport.w
        yDeltaPillarsOuter guide: Depends on support bars' yDeltaPillarsOuter.
        Rafter guides: Depends on rafters

Some pseudocode:

function SVG(viewportRect, carportRect) {

    carportRect = x, y, l, w;

    supportBars[] = supportBars(carportRect);
    pillars[] = pillars(supportBars[]);
    rafters[] = rafters(carportRect);

    carportHeightGuide = carportHeightGuide(carportRect);
    supportBarDeltaGuide = supportBarDeltaGuide(supportBars[]);
    rafterGuides[] = rafterGuides(rafters[]);

    svg.addElements(all the above);

}
